# AuroraUV
Numerical codes for simulating UV auroral emission, and color ratio in hydrogen atmospheres.

##Description

The laboratory spectrum for electron impact UV emission is adopted from Liu, Xianming,
Syed M. Ahmed, Rosalie A. Multari, Geoffrey K. James, and Joseph M. Ajello.
"High-resolution electron-impact study of the far-ultraviolet emission spectrum of
molecular hydrogen." Astrophysical Journal Supplement v. 101, p. 375 101 (1995): 375.


##Applications
In its current form, it is applied to high-energy electron deposition in Jupiter's
atmosphere. Inputs from a continuous slowing down approximation model are used to
calculate the amount of UV emission and normalize w.r.t. H$_{2}$ laboratory spectra.
